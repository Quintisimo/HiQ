Assault maps have two points that the attacking team must capture in order to win the game, with the defending team trying to stop them under a time limit. Escort objective maps usually requires the attacking team to deliver a payload to a certain point before time runs out, while the defending team tries to stop them. Control maps require each team to capture and then control the point until the percentage indicator reaches 100%."
